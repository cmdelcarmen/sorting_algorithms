# Learning Objectives:  
  
• At least four different sorting algorithms  
• What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm    
• How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input   
• What is a stable sorting algorithm    

The files \*-O, contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the sorting algorithm:  
  
• in the best case  
• in the average case  
• in the worst case
